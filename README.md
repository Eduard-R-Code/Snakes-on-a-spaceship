# Snakes on a spaceship!

“Snakes on a spaceship” is the title of this “Space Invaders”-type of game. 

In this mini-game, snakes, Pythons to be more precise, are on a mission to conquer the solar system, but they encountered some resistance. 
Take control of the ship and destroy all who oppose the mighty Pythons!

## Extra

<i> The title is a play on words of the title of the major flop Hollywood movie: "Snakes on a plane". </i>



## Future Development

Increase the types of enemy NPCs and make them stronger (requiring multiple shots to defeat) using the designs already present in the game files.
